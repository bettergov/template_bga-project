# BGA Project template

This is a template for off-platform pages using [@politico/interactive-templates](https://github.com/The-Politico/politico-interactive-templates) (or PIT).

FYI, as it stands now, I've had middling results with this â€” a lot of configuration, a lengthy build process. Working with prefab frameworks like Gatsby would probably work better... YMMV.

# Quick start

1. Install PIT:

```
$ npm install -g @politico/interactive-templates @politico/interactive-bin
```

2. Register this template:

```
$ pit register https://github.com/bettergov/template_bga-project
```

3. Make a new instance:

```
$ mkdir pit-project
$ cd pit-project
$ pit new
```

4. Choose `BGA Project` as the template and answer the prompts.
